An implementation of Google File System (GFS), complete with a metadata server (m_server.c), chunk servers (d_server.c) and client(s) (client.c). Implemented on the local system only though, simulating entities with processes.

And also a terminal shell (shell.c). Able to accept commands, fork and exec to handle them, and capable of handling piping and redirection.
