An implementation of Google File System (GFS), complete with a metadata server (m_server), chunk servers (d_server) and client(s). Implemented on the local system only though, simulating entities with processes.

And also a terminal shell. Able to accept commands, fork and exec to handle them, and capable of handling piping and redirection.
